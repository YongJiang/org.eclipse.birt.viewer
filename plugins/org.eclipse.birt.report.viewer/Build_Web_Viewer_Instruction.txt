Following are the steps to generate a web viewer which can work in Standalone Tomcat:

1. Before create a web viewer, make sure that DTP ODA binary is setup in your Eclipse
   Please use the latest stable build of DTP, you can download it from http://www.eclipse.org/datatools/downloads.html

2. Make sure org.apache.batik.pdf, org.apache.batik and org.apache.xerces plugins are checked out to your workspace.
   They can be found in (part of map files)
   plugin@org.apache.batik=HEAD,:pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/technology,,org.eclipse.gmf/plugins/org.apache.batik 
   plugin@org.apache.batik.pdf=HEAD,:pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/technology,,org.eclipse.gmf/plugins/org.apache.batik.pdf 
   plugin@org.apache.xerces=HEAD,:pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/webtools,,wst/components/xml/thirdparty/org.apache.xerces
   
3. Use Ant Build to call Jar target in BuildWebViewer.xml to create web viewer framework
   When build is successful, birt_web is created under root of viewer plugin, and web viewer framework is put under birt_web.
   Make sure property 'eclipse.home' has been set value when running from ant.

4. Download iText1.3 from http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itext/itext-1.3.jar, copy it to birt_web/WEB-INF/platform/plugins/com.lowagie.itext/lib folder

5. After above steps, birt_web can be deployed in Tomcat
