Following are the steps to generate a web viewer which can work in Standalone Tomcat:
1. Use Ant Build to call Jar target in BuildWebViewer.xml to create web viewer framework
   When build success, birt_web is created under root of viewer plugin, and web viewer framework is put under birt_web.
2. Download the latest nightly build of DTP from http://www.eclipse.org/datatools/downloads.html, copy 3 DTP plugins to birt_web/WEB-INF/platform/plugins folder, they are:
   org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity
   org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.oda
   org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.oda.flatfile
   Note: After DTP is stable enough, they will be copied by build script instead of manually, just like the usage of EMF
3. Download iText1.3 from http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itext/itext-1.3.jar, copy it to birt_web/WEB-INF/platform/plugins/com.lowagie.itext/lib folder
4. After above steps, birt_web can be deployed in Tomcat
